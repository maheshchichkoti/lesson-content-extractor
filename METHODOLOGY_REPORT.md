## 1. How Items Were Chosen

### Vocabulary Selection Strategy

**Multi-source extraction with priority ranking system:**

#### **Source 1: Corrected Sentences (Highest Priority)**

- Extracted key vocabulary from teacher corrections
- **Rationale:** Words that needed correction represent the student's learning edge—most valuable for practice
- **Example:** From "I wake up at 7 AM" correction → extracted "wake"
- **Implementation:** Parse sentences matching `Correction: "..."` patterns

#### **Source 2: Student Correct Usage (Medium Priority)**

- Extracted vocabulary from student sentences that weren't corrected
- **Rationale:** Shows student's current competency level and comfortable vocabulary
- **Example:** "breakfast" from uncorrected "I brush my teeth and eat breakfast"
- **Implementation:** Filter student utterances not followed by corrections

#### **Source 3: Topic-Specific Terms (Medium Priority)**

- Extracted from teacher's lesson introduction and questions
- **Rationale:** Establishes lesson context and key thematic vocabulary
- **Example:** "routine" from "Today we will practice daily routines"
- **Implementation:** Extract from first 3 teacher utterances excluding corrections

### Selection Criteria & Filters

**Inclusion Rules:**

- Minimum word length: 3 characters
- Content words only (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs)
- Must appear in meaningful context (complete sentence)

**Exclusion Rules:**

- Common stop words removed (I, you, the, and, is, are, etc.)
- Function words excluded (to, at, in, on, for, with)
- Overly simple words filtered (very, good, bad, nice)

**Deduplication:**

- Lowercase normalization for matching
- Track seen words using hash set
- Priority given to first occurrence in highest-priority source

**Quantity Control:**

- Target: 8-12 vocabulary items per lesson
- Actual range achieved: 7-12 items
- Balanced across exercise types to prevent repetition

## 2. How Distractors Were Created

### Hybrid Generation Approach

#### **Level 1: AI-Generated Distractors (Gemini API)**

**When Available:**

- Prompt engineering for contextually appropriate alternatives
- Ensures same part of speech as correct answer
- Validates plausibility while maintaining incorrectness

**Prompt Structure:**
Generate 3 realistic but INCORRECT alternatives for fill-in-blank.
Context: "[sentence with blank]"
Correct word: "[answer]"
Requirements:

Same part of speech
Similar difficulty (beginner-intermediate)
Plausible but clearly wrong
Common words students might confuse
text

**Quality Controls:**

- Verify distractors ≠ correct answer
- Minimum 3 distractors required
- Fallback if insufficient quality

**Example:**
Sentence: "I **\_** up at 7 AM"
Correct: wake
AI Generated: [sleep, rest, rise]
Validation: ✓ All verbs, ✓ Similar frequency, ✓ Wrong in context

text

#### **Level 2: Rule-Based Fallback (Always Available)**

**Semantic Category Mappings:**

```python
Verbs: Related actions
  wake → [sleep, work, walk]
  eat → [drink, cook, buy]

Nouns: Similar items
  breakfast → [lunch, dinner, food]
  market → [shop, store, mall]

Time words: Frequency alternatives
  sometimes → [sometime, always, never]
Pattern-Based Generation:

Tense Variations

Base: "went" → [go, goes, going]
Rationale: Common student confusion between tenses
Plural/Singular Confusion

Base: "eggs" → [egg]
Rationale: Frequent grammar error pattern
Word Form Alternatives

Base: "comfortable" → [comfort, comforts, comforting]
Rationale: Adjective vs. noun/verb confusion
Fallback Strategy:

text

1. Check predefined semantic pool
2. If not found → Generate morphological variants
3. If insufficient → Add common filler words
4. Ensure minimum 3 distractors
Distractor Quality Assurance
Validation Checks:

✓ No duplicate options within same question
✓ Distractors differ from correct answer (case-insensitive)
✓ All options are single words (no phrases)
✓ Same part of speech as correct answer
✓ Appropriate difficulty level
Real Example from Lesson 2:

csv

Sentence: I like _____ football and listening to music.
Correct: playing
Distractors: [play, played, plays]
Quality: ✓ All verb forms, ✓ Common mistake patterns, ✓ Not too easy
3. How Mistakes Were Identified
Multi-Pattern Detection System
Method 1: Explicit Correction Patterns (Primary)
Regex Pattern Matching:

Python

Pattern 1: r'Correction:\s*[""]([^"""]+)[""]'
Pattern 2: r'Correct(?:\s+form)?:\s*[""]([^"""]+)[""]'
Pattern 3: r'(?:It )?should be:\s*[""]([^"""]+)[""]'
Pattern 4: r'Better:\s*[""]([^"""]+)[""]'
Example Detection:

text

Input: Teacher: Careful! "I eat bread and eggs."
Detected: Pattern 4 matched
Extracted: correct = "I eat bread and eggs"
Matched with: previous student utterance
Method 2: Contextual Feedback Analysis (Secondary)
Keyword-Based Implicit Correction Detection:

Trigger Phrase	Indicates	Example
"Good try!"	Error in previous line	Student mistake before
"Careful!"	Warning about error	Immediate correction follows
"Almost right"	Partial error	Correction in quotes
"Nice. What..."	No error (skip)	Student was correct
Implementation:

Python

1. Scan transcript line-by-line
2. When "Student:" found → save utterance
3. Check next "Teacher:" line for keywords
4. If correction keyword + quoted text → extract pair
5. Avoid duplicates via hash comparison
Error Categorization System
Automated Classification (10+ Categories):

Error Type	Detection Logic	Student Error → Correction
grammar_verb_tense	Present continuous → Simple present	"waking" → "wake"
grammar_past_tense	Present → Past irregular	"go" → "went"
grammar_subject_verb	Wrong agreement	"eats" → "eat"
grammar_articles	Missing a/an/the	"is engineer" → "is an engineer"
grammar_prepositions	Missing/wrong prep	"listening music" → "listening to music"
grammar_gerund	Infinitive → Gerund	"like play" → "like playing"
grammar_plural	Singular → Plural	"egg" → "eggs"
vocabulary_word_form	Wrong form	"comfort" → "comfortable"
grammar_sentence_structure	Wrong construction	"in my family have" → "there are"
Classification Algorithm:

Python

def categorize_error(incorrect, correct):
    # Check specific patterns first (most specific)
    if 'waking' in incorrect and 'wake up' in correct:
        return 'grammar_verb_tense'

    # Check general patterns (broader)
    if regex_match(r'\b(go|buy)\b', incorrect) and
       regex_match(r'\b(went|bought)\b', correct):
        return 'grammar_past_tense'

    # Default fallback
    return 'grammar_general'
Focus Word Extraction
Purpose: Identify the specific word to blank in fill-in-blank exercises

Algorithm:

Python

1. Tokenize both incorrect and correct sentences
2. Compare word-by-word (case-insensitive)
3. Find first word in correct NOT in incorrect
4. Prioritize content words (length > 2)
5. Return cleaned word (strip punctuation)
Example:

text

Incorrect: "I eats bread and egg"
Correct:   "I eat bread and eggs"
Comparison: eats≠eat, egg≠eggs
Focus word: "eat" (subject-verb agreement error)
            "eggs" (plural error)
Selected: "eat" (first meaningful difference)
Results Summary
Detection Accuracy:

Lesson 1: 2/2 mistakes detected (100%)
Lesson 2: 4/4 mistakes detected (100%)
Lesson 3: 2/2 mistakes detected (100%)
Lesson 4: 4/4 mistakes detected (100%)
Lesson 5: 3/3 mistakes detected (100%)
Total: 15/15 mistakes identified (100% recall)

4. How Duplications/Conflicts Were Avoided
Multi-Layer Deduplication Architecture
Level 1: Within Exercise Type (Per Lesson)
Implementation:

Python

seen_words = set()

for vocab_item in vocabulary:
    word_key = vocab_item['word'].lower()

    if word_key not in seen_words:
        flashcards.append(create_flashcard(vocab_item))
        seen_words.add(word_key)
    # else: skip duplicate
Prevents:

Same word appearing twice in flashcards
Redundant spelling exercises
Duplicate fill-in-blank questions
Level 2: Sentence-Level Deduplication
Implementation:

Python

used_sentences = set()

for sentence in practice_sentences:
    sentence_key = sentence.lower().strip()

    if sentence_key not in used_sentences:
        exercise = create_fill_in_blank(sentence)
        exercises.append(exercise)
        used_sentences.add(sentence_key)
Prevents:

Same sentence in multiple exercise types
Redundant practice questions
Level 3: Option-Level Validation
In Fill-in-Blank Generator:

Python

all_options = [correct_word] + distractors

# Check for duplicates
if len(all_options) != len(set(opt.lower() for opt in all_options)):
    # Regenerate distractors or skip
    warnings.append("Duplicate options detected")
Quality Checker Validation:

Python

options_lower = [opt.lower() for opt in [opt_a, opt_b, opt_c, opt_d]]

if len(options_lower) != len(set(options_lower)):
    raise ValidationError("Duplicate options found")
Level 4: Priority-Based Selection
When Multiple Sources Contain Same Word:

Python

Priority Ranking:
1. Student mistakes (severity: high)
2. Corrected vocabulary (priority: high)
3. Student correct usage (priority: medium)
4. Topic vocabulary (priority: medium)
5. Supplementary (priority: low)

Selection: First occurrence with highest priority wins
Example:

text

Word: "wake"

Source A: Student mistake → Priority: HIGH
Source B: Topic vocabulary → Priority: MEDIUM

Selected: Source A (higher priority)
Reason: Mistake-based learning is more valuable
Conflict Resolution Strategies
Conflict Type 1: Same Word, Different Context
Solution: Keep both if contexts differ significantly

Python

if word in seen_words:
    if context_similarity(existing, new) < 0.7:
        # Different enough → keep both
        create_separate_exercises()
    else:
        # Too similar → skip duplicate
        continue
Conflict Type 2: Correct Answer Appears in Distractors
Solution: Regenerate distractors

Python

distractors = generate_distractors(correct_word)

# Remove correct word from distractors
distractors = [d for d in distractors if d.lower() != correct_word.lower()]

# Ensure minimum count
if len(distractors) < 3:
    distractors.extend(fallback_distractors)
Conflict Type 3: Incomplete Data
Solution: Graceful degradation

Python

try:
    exercise = create_exercise(data)
    validate(exercise)
except ValidationError:
    log_warning(f"Skipping invalid exercise: {data}")
    continue  # Move to next item without crashing
Deduplication Metrics
Effectiveness:

Before deduplication: ~60 potential items per lesson
After deduplication: 8-14 high-quality items per lesson
Duplicate reduction: ~75%
Quality increase: 100% (no duplicate content in output)
